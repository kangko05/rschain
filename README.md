# RSChain

RSChain is an experimental blockchain implementation written in Rust. This project aims to demonstrate fundamental blockchain concepts through a practical implementation, focusing on distributed systems and peer-to-peer communication.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust
- **Network Protocol**: Kademlia DHT for peer discovery and P2P communication (TCP)
- **Consensus Algorithm**: Proof of Work (PoW)
- **Architecture**: Modular design with separate components for blockchain, networking, and node types

## Core Components

### Blockchain Module
- **Block Management**: Implementation of block structure and validation
- **Chain**: Blockchain state management and consensus rules
- **Transactions**: Transaction creation, validation, and processing
- **Merkle Tree**: Efficient verification of transaction inclusion
- **Transaction Pool**: Memory pool for pending transactions

### Network Module
- **Kademlia DHT**: Distributed hash table for peer discovery
- **Message Handling**: Protocol for node communication
- **Network Operations**: Core P2P networking functionalities

### Node Types
- **Bootstrap Node**: Entry point for new nodes joining the network
- **Full Node**: Maintains complete blockchain state
- **Light Node**: Operates with reduced blockchain data
- **Mining Node**: Performs proof-of-work mining operations

### Wallet Module
- Basic wallet functionality for key management and transaction signing

## Project Status

This project is currently under development and serves as an educational implementation of blockchain concepts. Key implemented features include:
